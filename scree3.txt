So in screen 3.tsx
Just read them in case mentioned about errot youll get and what and all is done:
//i have wrotten working this thta means tht section is working completly fine with api amd eveyrthing


Completed :
HISTORY AND WATERING DURATION

REMAINIING:
WATERING TIME
TAP ON/OFF
LIVE STATUS - FETCH TABLE (dik COLIMN)


So if you pulled my(lima) commit that is history wokring one new one, 
then you can see watering durtaion and history is Completed,

IF HISTORY FOR THAT PARTICULAR NODE U NEED THEN, U NEED TO MANUALLYY INSERT VALUES INTO HISTORY TABLE, 
BECAUSE VALUE FOR HISTORY TABLE WILL BE GIVEN BY HARDWARE PIPE AND VALVE BASEDD ON THEIR FLOW
SO IF U WANT HISTORY TO WORK THE INSERT VALVEID AND GIVE SOME VALUES TO CHECK IF ITS WOKRING , OTHERWISE YOULL GET ERROR

AND WATERING DURATION 
TWO API USED BECAUSE ONE WAS NEEDED TO STORE VALUES IN DB AND ONE MORE ONCE U SAVE VALUES IN DB,
 AND U GO TO NEXT NODE, AND COME BACK AGAIN TO SAME NODE, U NEED TO HAVE THE SET(before goinf bak whuch u set) VALUE IT SHOULD be there right sor tht pupose ,

MAKE SURE U HAVE VALUES IN DB OKAY FLOWMETER BATTERY AND ALL OTHERISE IT WONT SHOW ANYTHING

SO HERE FLOWMETER AND BATTERY WE ARE FETCHINMG THRIUGH NODE ID
HISTORY AND WATER DURATION THRUGH VALVEID



ERRORS YOULL GET :'

THEN one error youll get given below: (even if this error is there u can coninue working itll jusrrt show like a warning message or something)
 (NOBRIDGE) ERROR  Warning: Text strings must be rendered within a <Text> component. (eror)
This ukl get because the styles here and jsx are together so its throwing some eror, we need to seprate them we cant keep them together,
 okay, wee need to create like how we did for screem2 and other screen, so once u seprate this error will be gone,

THEN RIME PICKER ERROR: (commented for now)(youll get this error when u uncomment time picker thing otherwise u wont)
that watering time ka i got time picker error so i commented that part, now if u are working on tht u needd to uncomment some parts
like time picker was needed to set time but for me it was showig error so i commenetd that
